This 8-day plan Local Event Finder webapp, simply with city dropdown + event list.
 * Manage it with Trello.

 * Start Date: Feb 26 at 10 AM
 * Daily Effort: 1-2 hrs/day.
 * End date: Mar 5

This is my porfolio project coming back to IT Project Manager after many years, while I am still with Dual Role Overhead, in charge of both the PM and dev sides, and end up with a polished “Local Event Finder” app for my portfolio, also the base for my next portfolios and projects.

You might wonder why it has to take up to 8 days to complete a very simple application, right? On the surface, it’s just a dropdown and a list, so it could feel like overskill. The real reason is that it suits my situation - balancing PM and dev roles, starting fresh after a long brea, and making it portfolio-worthy as the sure thing I can make it happen first.

Building app this time is an extra task to do, as I mainly focus on managing task, starting with Trello.

Next project I will also use Jira.

## Day 1, Day 2 ##
Stick well to the plan, and with outstanding result.

Check https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2HbuJE6w_nvpPUQ9kyV3FT1fDEFW47KZWukcqiQ4vc/edit?tab=t.5lhpjiltvf6m#heading=h.e4wuxvf14bfc for more detail
- Task status and Trello status updated

## Day 3 ##
Today both PM and dev had our own matters, so we had to work late.

As we are already good on Homepage, dev suggests to switch to the next task, Start coding the result page.

During the time working on the result-page, dev found lots of code cannot be reused between files, and there will be a lot of duplication in future.

**They suggested switching to PHP instead of pure HTML. We should do it as soon as possible.**

We already discuss, and add a card in the TODO so that everyone can be aware of and to contribute their solution, with a card with higher priority.

The code result page can be continued working as it can be merged later into PHP.

DAY 3 ended quite smoothly, but still there will be a BIG PROPOSAL to be decided by tomorrow before noon.

## DAY 4, DAY 5 : OFF ##
* Due to unexpectedly urgent matters that all members cannot work on the projects but we can meet face-to-face.
* We also took the chance to discuss the PHP switching and led to the agreement.

### Go with Option 2 - PHP switching ###
* We decided to go with Option 2 - PHP switching and deploy to the team member’s host.
* ⇒ That unexpected matter still didn’t impact our plan. We will also modify the task list a little bit.

## DAY 6 ##
* The team performance is so good, they now finished the deploy task to live host as bellow Trello updated.
* Day 6 ended very smoothly. The devs said that the development became extremely easier when we switch from pure HTML to PHP.
