This is my porfolio project coming back to IT Project Manager after many years, while I am still with Dual Role Overhead, in charge of both the PM and dev sides, and end up with a polished “Local Event Finder” app for my portfolio, also the base for my next portfolios and projects.

You might wonder why it has to take up to 8 days to complete a very simple application, right? On the surface, it’s just a dropdown and a list, so it could feel like overskill. The real reason is that it suits my situation - balancing PM and dev roles, starting fresh after a long brea, and making it portfolio-worthy as the sure thing I can make it happen first.

Building app this time is an extra task to do, as I mainly focus on managing task, starting with Trello.

Next project I will also use Jira.
